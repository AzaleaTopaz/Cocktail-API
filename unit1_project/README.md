# Let's shake (or stir) it up!

## What am I making?

For this project, I'd like to inform folks how to make 
cocktails of their choosing. Anything from Tiki to the classics. This web page will let the users browse through their favorite spirits to make their perfect cocktail and impress their guests. 
## metric conversion
I want the user to be able to convert to a metric unit that they are most familiar with so this page can be used on a global scale.
## Feedback and share recipes!
I want the user to be able to share their comments as well as share their own recipes that they have come up with. (both in different text fields).

## What do I need?
Here's what I need in order for this to work:
* spirit directory
* image of cocktail
* metric converter
* textfield for comments
* textfield to submit their own cocktail recipes.
